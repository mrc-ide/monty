##' @param progress Optional logical, indicating if we should print a
##'   progress bar while running.  If `NULL`, we use the value of the
##'   option `monty.progress` if set, otherwise we show the progress
##'   bar (as it is typically wanted).  The progress bar itself
##'   responds to cli's options; in particular
##'   `cli.progress_show_after` and `cli.progress_clear` will affect
##'   your experience.  Alternatively, you can provide a string
##'   indicating the progress bar type.  Options are `fancy`
##'   (equivalent to `TRUE`), `none` (equivalent to `FALSE`) and
##'   `simple` (a very simple text-mode progress indicator designed
##'   play nicely with logging; it does not use special codes to clear
##'   the line).

##' Run MCMC chains in parallel (at the same time).  This runner uses
##' the `parallel` package to distribute your chains over a number of
##' worker processes on the same machine.  Compared with
##' [monty_runner_callr] (Whch is similar to the "worker" support in
##' `mcstate` version 1), this is very simple.  In particular we do
##' not report back any information about progress while a chain is
##' running on a worker or even across chains.  There's also no
##' support to warn you if your number of chains do not neatly divide
##' through by the number of workers.  Mostly this exists as a proof
##' of concept for us to think about the different interfaces.  Unless
##' your chains are quite slow, the parallel runner will be slower
##' than the serial runner ([monty_runner_serial]) due to the overhead
##' cost of starting the cluster.

##' @param n_workers Number of workers to create a cluster from.  In a
##'   multi-user setting be careful not to set this to more cores than
##'   you are allowed to use.  You can use `parallel::detectCores()`
##'   to get an estimate of the number of cores you have on a single
##'   user system (but this is often an overestimate as it returns the
##'   number of logical cores, including those from "hyperthreading").
##'   Fewer cores than this will be used if you run fewer chains than
##'   you have workers.
