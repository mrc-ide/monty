##' Build a packer, which can be used to translate between an
##' unstructured vector of numbers (the vector being updated by an
##' MCMC for example) and a structured list of named values, which is
##' easier to program against.  This is useful for the bridge between
##' model parameters and a models's implementation, but it is also
##' useful for the state vector in a state-space model.  We refer to
##' the process of taking a named list of scalars, vectors and arrays
##' and converting into a single vector "packing" and the inverse
##' "unpacking".
##'
##' There are several places where it is most convenient to work in an
##' unstructured vector:
##'
##' * An MCMC is typically discussed as a the updating of some
##'   vector `x` to another `x'`
##' * An optimisation algorithm will try and find a set of values for
##'   a vector `x` that minimises (or maximises) some function `f(x)`
##' * An ode solver works with a vector `x(t)` (`x` at time `t`) and
##'   considers `x(t + h)` by computing the vector of derivatives
##'   `dx(t)/dt`
##'
##' In all these cases, the algorithm that needs the vector of numbers
##' knows nothing about what they represent.  Commonly, these will be
##' a packed vector of parameters.  So our vector `x` might actually
##' represent the parameters `a`, `b` and `c` in a vector as `[a, b,
##' c]` - this is a very common pattern, and you have probably
##' implemented this yourself.
##'
##' In more complex settings, we might want our vector `x` to collect
##' more structured quantities.  Suppose that you are fitting a model
##' with an age-structured or sex-structured parameter.  Rather than
##' having a series of scalars packed into your vector `x` you might
##' have a series of values destined to be treated as a vector:
##'
##' ```
##' | 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  |
##' | a  b  c  d1 d2 d3 d4 |
##' ```
##'
##' So here we might have a vector of length 7, where the first three
##' elements will represent be the scalar values `a`, `b` and `c` but
##' the next four will be a vector `d`.
##'
##' Unpacked, this might be written as:
##'
##' ```
##' list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4:7)
##' ```
##'
##' The machinery here is designed to make these transformations
##' simple and standardised within monty, and should be flexible
##' enough for many situations.  We will also use these from within
##' `dust2` and `odin2` for transformations in and out of vectors of
##' ODE state.
##'
##' # When to use `process`
##'
##' The `process` function is a get-out-of-jail function designed to
##' let you do arbitrary transformations when unpacking a vector.  In
##' general, this should not be the first choice to use because it is
##' less easy to reason about by other tooling (for example, as we
##' develop automatic differentiation support for use with the HMC
##' algorithm, a `process` function will be problematic because we
##' will need to make sure we can differentiate this process).
##' However, there are cases where it will be only way to achieve some
##' results.
##'
##' Imagine that you are packing a 2x2 covariance matrix into your
##' vector in order to use within an MCMC or optimisation algorithm.
##' Ultimately, our unpacked vector will need to hold four elements
##' (`b11`, `b12`, `b21`, `b22`), but there are only three distinct
##' values as the two off-diagonal elements will be the same (i.e.,
##' `b12 == b21`).  So we might write this passing in `b_raw = 3` to
##' `array`, so that our unpacked list holds `b_raw = c(b11, b12,
##' b22)`.  We would then write `process` as something like:
##'
##' ```
##' process <- function(x) {
##'   list(b = matrix(x$b_raw[c(1, 2, 2, 3)], 2, 2))
##' }
##' ```
##'
##' which creates the symmetric 2x2 matrix `b` from `b_raw`.
##'
##' # Unpacking matrices
##'
##' If you do not use `fixed` or `process` when defining your packer,
##' then you can use `$unpack()` with a matrix or higher-dimensional
##' output.  There are two ways that you might like to unpack this
##' sort of output.  Assume you have a matrix `m` with 3 rows and 2
##' columns; this means that we have two sets of parameters or state
##' (one per column) and 3 states within each; this is the format that
##' MCMC parameters will be in for example.
##'
##' The first would to be return a list where the `i`th element is the
##' result of unpacking the `i`th parameter/state vector.  You can do
##' this by running
##'
##' ```
##' apply(m, 2, p$unpack)
##' ```
##'
##' The second would be to return a named list with three elements
##' where the `ith` element is the unpacked version of the `i`th
##' state.  In this case you can pass the matrix directly in to the
##' unpacker:
##'
##' ```
##' p$unpack(m)
##' ```
##'
##' When you do this, the elements of `m` will acquire an additional
##' dimension; scalars become vectors (one per set), vectors become
##' matrices (one column per set) and so on.
##'
##' This approach generalises to higher dimensional input, though we
##' suspect you'll spend a bit of time head-scratching if you use it.
##'
##' # Packing lists into vectors and matrices
##'
##' The unpacking operation is very common - an MCMC proceeds,
##' produces an unstructured vector, and you unpack it into a list in
##' order to be able to easily work with it.  The reverse is much less
##' common, where we take a list and convert it into a vector (or
##' matrix, or multidimensional array).  Use of this direction
##' ("packing") may be more common where using packers to work with
##' the output of state-space models (e.g. in
##' [odin2](https://mrc-ide.github.io/odin2) or
##' [dust2](https://mrc-ide.github.io/dust2), which use this
##' machinery).
##'
##' The input to `pack()` will be the shape that `unpack()` returned;
##' a named list of numerical vectors, matrices and arrays.  The names
##' must correspond to the names in your packer (i.e., `scalar` and
##' the names of `array`).  Each element has dimensions
##'
##' ```
##' <...object, ...residual>
##' ```
##'
##' where `...object` is the dimensions of the data itself and
##' `...residual` is the dimensions of the hypothetical input to
##' `pack`.
##'
##' There is an unfortunate ambiguity in R's lack of true scalar types
##' that we cannot avoid.  It is hard to tell the difference packing a
##' vector vs packing an array where all dimensions are 1.  See the
##' examples, and please let us know if the behaviour needs changing.
##'
##' @title Build a packer
##'
##' @param scalar Names of scalars.  This is similar for listing
##'   elements in `array` with values of 1, though elements in
##'   `scalar` will be placed ahead of those listed in `array` within
##'   the final parameter vector, and elements in `array` will have
##'   generated names that include square brackets.
##'
##' @param array A list, where names correspond to the names of arrays
##'   and values correspond to their lengths.  Multiple dimensions are
##'   allowed (so if you provide an element with two entries these
##'   represent dimensions of a matrix).  Zero-length integer vectors
##'   or `NULL` values are counted as scalars, which allows you to put
##'   scalars at positions other than the front of the packing
##'   vector. In future, you may be able to use *strings* as values
##'   for the lengths, in which case these will be looked for within
##'   `fixed`.
##'
##' @param fixed A named list of fixed data to be inserted into the
##'   final unpacked list; these will be added into the final list
##'   directly.  In the parameter packer context, these typically
##'   represent additional pieces of data that your model needs to
##'   run, but which you are not performing inference on.
##'
##' @param process An arbitrary R function that will be passed the
##'   final assembled list; it may create any *additional* entries,
##'   which will be concatenated onto the original list.  If you use
##'   this you should take care not to return any values with the same
##'   names as entries listed in `scalar`, `array` or `fixed`, as this
##'   is an error (this is so that `pack()` is not broken).  We will
##'   likely play around with this process in future in order to get
##'   automatic differentiation to work.
##'
##' @return An object of class `monty_packer`, which has elements:
##'
##' * `names`: a function that returns a character vector of computed
##'   names; in the parameter packer context these are the names that
##'   your statistical model will use.
##'
##' * `unpack`: a function that can unpack an unstructured vector
##'   (say, from your statistical model parameters) into a structured
##'   list (say, for your generative model)
##'
##' * `pack`: a function that can pack your structured list of data
##'   back into a numeric vector, for example suitable for a
##'   statistical model.  This ignores values created by a
##'   `preprocess` function and present in `fixed`.
##'
##' * `index`: a function which produces a named list where each
##'   element has the name of a value in `scalar` or `array` and each
##'   value has the indices within an unstructured vector where these
##'   values can be found, in the shape of the data that would be
##'   unpacked.  This is of limited most use to most people.
##'
##' * `subset`: an experimental interface which can be used to subset
##'   a packer to a packer for a subset of contents. Documentation
##'   will be provided once the interface settles, but this is for
##'   advanced use only!

  ## things from 'd' with d[-i] because that will drop everything.
  ## Second, when working out the residual dimensions of the packed
  ## data we might have a situation where there are some scalars for
  ## which we think the residual dimension is 1 and some non-scalars
  ## where we think there is no residual dimension.  This is actually
  ## the same situation.  This is explored a bit in the tests and the
  ## examples above.
