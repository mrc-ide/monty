##' Create an observer to extract additional details from your model
##' during the sampling process.
##'
##' Sometimes you want to extract additional information from your
##' model as your chain runs.  The case we see this most is when
##' running MCMC with a particle filter (pmcmc); in this case while
##' the likelihood calculation is running we are computing lots of
##' interesting quantities such as the final state of the system
##' (required for onward simulation) and filtered trajectories through
##' time.  Because these are stochastic we can't even just rerun the
##' model with our sampled parameter sets, because the final states
##' that are recovered depend also on the random number generators
##' (practically we would not want to, as it is quite expensive to
##' compute these quantities).
##'
##' The observer mechanism allows you to carry out arbitrary
##' additional calculations with your model at the end of the step.

##' @title Create observer
##'
##' @param observe A function that will run with arguments `model`
##'   (the model that you passed in to [monty_model]) and `rng` (an
##'   rng object).  This function should return a list.  It is best if
##'   the list returned is named, with no duplicated names, and with
##'   return values that have the same exact dimensions for every
##'   iteration.  If you do this, then you will not have to provide
##'   any of the following arguments, which are going to be hard to
##'   describe and worse to implement.
##'
##' @param finalise A function that runs after a single chain has run,
##'   and you use to simplify across all samples drawn from that
##'   chain.  Takes a single argument which is the list with one set
##'   of observations per sample.
##'
##' @param combine A function that runs after all chains have run, and
##'   you use to simplify across chains.  Takes a single argument,
##'   which is the list with one set of observations per chain.
##'
##' @param append A function that runs after a continuation of chain
##'   has run (via [monty_sample_continue].  Takes two arguments
##'   representing the fully simplified observations from the first
##'   and second chains.
##'
##' @return An object with class `monty_observer` which can be
##'   passed in to `monty_sample`.
