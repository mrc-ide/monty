\arguments{
\item{initial_vcv}{An initial variance covariance matrix; we'll start
using this in the proposal, which will gradually become more weighted
towards the empirical covariance matrix calculated from the chain.}

\item{initial_vcv_weight}{Weight of the initial variance-covariance
matrix used to build the proposal of the random-walk. Higher
values translate into higher confidence of the initial
variance-covariance matrix and means that update from additional
samples will be slower.}

\item{initial_scaling}{The initial scaling of the variance
covariance matrix to be used to generate the multivariate normal
proposal for the random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. To generate
the proposal matrix, the weighted variance covariance matrix is
multiplied by the scaling parameter squared times 2.38^2 / n_pars (where
n_pars is the number of fitted parameters). Thus, in a Gaussian target
parameter space, the optimal scaling will be around 1.}

\item{initial_scaling_weight}{The initial weight used in the scaling update.
The scaling weight will increase after the first \code{pre_diminish}
iterations, and as the scaling weight increases the adaptation of the
scaling diminishes. If \code{NULL} (the default) the value is
5 / (acceptance_target * (1 - acceptance_target)).}

\item{min_scaling}{The minimum scaling of the variance covariance
matrix to be used to generate the multivariate normal proposal
for the random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.}

\item{scaling_increment}{The scaling increment which is added or
subtracted to the scaling factor of the variance-covariance
after each adaptive step. If \code{NULL} (the default) then an optimal
value will be calculated.}

\item{log_scaling_update}{Logical, whether or not changes to the
scaling parameter are made on the log-scale.}

\item{acceptance_target}{The target for the fraction of proposals
that should be accepted (optimally) for the adaptive part of the
chain.}

\item{forget_rate}{The rate of forgetting early parameter sets from the
empirical variance-covariance matrix in the MCMC chains. For example,
\code{forget_rate = 0.2} (the default) means that once in every 5th iterations
we remove the earliest parameter set included, so would remove the 1st
parameter set on the 5th update, the 2nd on the 10th update, and so
on. Setting \code{forget_rate = 0} means early parameter sets are never
forgotten.}

\item{forget_end}{The final iteration at which early parameter sets can
be forgotten. Setting \code{forget_rate = Inf} (the default) means that the
forgetting mechanism continues throughout the chains. Forgetting early
parameter sets becomes less useful once the chains have settled into the
posterior mode, so this parameter might be set as an estimate of how long
that would take.}

\item{adapt_end}{The final iteration at which we can adapt the multivariate
normal proposal. Thereafter the empirical variance-covariance matrix, its
scaling and its weight remain fixed. This allows the adaptation to be
switched off at a certain point to help ensure convergence of the chain.}

\item{pre_diminish}{The number of updates before adaptation of the scaling
parameter starts to diminish. Setting \code{pre_diminish = 0} means there is
diminishing adaptation of the scaling parameter from the offset, while
\code{pre_diminish = Inf} would mean there is never diminishing adaptation.
Diminishing adaptation should help the scaling parameter to converge
better, but while the chains find the location and scale of the posterior
mode it might be useful to explore with it switched off.}

\description{
Create an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings sampler, which will tune
its variance covariance matrix (vs the simple random walk
sampler \link{monty_sampler_random_walk}).
}
\details{
Efficient exploration of the parameter space during an MCMC might
be difficult when the target distribution is of high
dimensionality, especially if the target probability distribution
present a high degree of correlation.  Adaptive schemes are used
to "learn" on the fly the correlation structure by updating the
proposal distribution by recalculating the empirical
variance-covariance matrix and rescale it at each adaptive step of
the MCMC.

Our implementation of an adaptive MCMC algorithm is based on an
adaptation of the "accelerated shaping" algorithm in Spencer (2021).
The algorithm is based on a random-walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm where
the proposal is a multi-variate Normal distribution centred on the current
point.
