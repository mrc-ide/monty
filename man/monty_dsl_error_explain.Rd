\description{
Explain error codes produced by monty.  This is a work in progress,
and we would like feedback on what is useful as we improve it.
The idea is that if you see an error you can link through to get
more information on what it means and how to resolve it.  The
current implementation of this will send you to the rendered
vignettes, but in the future we will arrange for offline rendering
too.
