\title{Information about supported distributions}
\usage{
monty_dsl_distributions()
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns
\itemize{
\item \code{name} the name of the distribution; each name begins with a
capital letter, and there are duplicate names where different
parameterisations are supported.
\item \code{args} the arguments of all parameters, \emph{except} the random
variable itself which is given as the first argument to density
functions.
}

We may expand the output here in the future to include information on
if distributions have support in C++, but we might end up
supporting everything this way soon.
}
\description{
Report information about supported distributions in the DSL.  This
is primarily intended for use in packages which use
\link{monty_dsl_parse_distribution}, as this function reports
information about which distributions and arguments would succeed
there.
}
\examples{
monty_dsl_distributions()
}
