create (hopefully) interesting examples in the documentation

these for anything other than exploring the package.}

monty_example(name, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Name of the example, as a string.  See Details for
supported models.}

\item{...}{Optional parameters that are passed to create the
model.  All models can be created with no additional parameters,
but you can tweak their behaviour by passing named parameters
here.  See Details.}

A \link{monty_model} object.
}
\description{
Load small, ready-made target distributions for demonstrations, tests,
and examples. These models exist so that we can create (hopefully)
interesting examples in the documentation without them becoming
overwhelming. All examples contain an analytic gradient and can
thus be also used to explore gradient-based samplers such as
\link{monty_sampler_hmc}.
}
\section{Supported models:}{
Each model has a \strong{arguments} that are passed through as \code{...} in
\code{monty_example} and are used to set up the example.  This creates
a \code{monty_model} object that will accept \strong{parameters}, which are
the values in the argument \code{parameters} passed to
\code{monty_model_density}.
\subsection{\code{banana}}{

The banana model is a two-dimensional banana-shaped function, with
strong local correlation.  This example was picked because it is
useful for illustrating the limitations of random-walk proposals.
The model has two parameters \code{alpha} and \code{beta} and is based on
two successive draws, one conditional on the other.

You can vary the argument \code{sigma} for this model on creation, the
default is 0.5
}

\subsection{\code{gaussian}}{

A multivariate Gaussian centred at the origin.  Takes a
variance-covariance-matrix as its argument.  Parameters are
letters a, b, ... up to the number of dimensions.
}

\subsection{\code{ring}}{

A two-dimensional ring-shaped density whose log-density is
proportional to $-(\|x\|-r)^2/(2\,sd^2)$.  Includes an analytic
gradient and a direct sampler in polar coordinates.  The
constructor takes that arguments \code{r} and \code{sd}, and the parameters
of the \code{monty_model} are \code{x1} and \code{x2} (corresponding to the two
dimensions of the polar coordinates).
}

\subsection{\code{mixture2d}}{

An equal-weight mixture of \code{k} isotropic 2D Gaussians with
standard deviation \code{sd} and centres either provided by the
argument (\code{means}) or drawn uniformly in a square of half-width
\code{spread}. Includes an analytic gradient.
